# Single-SNP-Analysis-of-Plant-Phenotypes
GWAS analysis using FaST-LMM.
This repository is exclusively created to host the results of my experiments.
The html files contains the results of the Single SNP association between the plant phenotypes and imputed binary SNP data.
The code may be helpful for others who find it difficult to use Binary SNP data of hdf5 format.
